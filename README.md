# Backend Challenge
Fat Lama relies heavily on our messaging system for users to be able to communicate with each other before and during rentals. For this challenge, we would like you to build a backend database and API for Fat Lama’s messaging system. Here is the interface that will be consuming your API:

Think about what endpoints an interface like this will need to do its job, and build them. Assume that auth is taken care of - you don't need to worry about this. Please think carefully about your technology and architecture, and when you are finished, write up a short summary of why you made the choices you did. This should be no more than 500 words.

## Features that are stretch goals (you will not lose points for not doing these): 
- Search for user/item by name
- Read receipts & live updating

## Things to think about:
- Don’t try to reverse-engineer the way that we’ve actually built this feature. Ours is not necessarily the best way to do it, and we want to see what you come up with by yourself.
- Think about 
- Testing: use whatever tools you prefer to test your code appropriately
- Try to implement appropriate [separation of concerns](https://effectivesoftwaredesign.com/2012/02/05/separation-of-concerns/) & modular code
- Think hard about naming of functions and variables
- Code style & file structure is up to you, but make sure it is consistent and easy to understand

## Checklist for Challenge
[ ] Build API endpoints for Fat Lama messaging interface
[ ] Ensure all code is sufficiently tested
[ ] Write brief summary on the approach you took and the tools you used (max 500 words)
